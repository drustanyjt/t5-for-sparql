# Design Doc

I needed some place to write out my design ideas.

### Part 1: Cleaning
Get data into a standardised structure.

### Part 2: Preprocessing + Entity/Relation Linking
The output of this should be a pandas table with two columns, input_ids and labels.

### Part 3: Model
This takes in a model with training parameters.

This should make us of a normal Pytorch model.

### Part 4: Training
This is responsible for starting and visualising the training
